# Metaquity Node

### Build

Use the following command to build the node without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

After you build the project, you can use the following command to explore its parameters and subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```

You can generate and view the [Rust Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-doc.html) for this template with this command:

```sh
cargo +nightly doc --open
```

### Single-Node Development Chain

The following command starts a single-node development chain that doesn't persist state:

```sh
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

To purge the development chain's state, run the following command:

```sh
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

To start the development chain with detailed logging, run the following command:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -ldebug --dev
```

Development chains:

- Maintain state in a `tmp` folder while the node is running.
- Use the **Alice** and **Bob** accounts as default validator authorities.
- Use the **Alice** account as the default `sudo` account.
- Are preconfigured with a genesis state (`/node/src/chain_spec.rs`) that includes several prefunded development accounts.


To persist chain state between runs, specify a base path by running a command similar to the following:

```sh
// Create a folder to use as the db base path
$ mkdir my-chain-state

// Use of that folder to store the chain state
$ ./target/release/node-template --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/

// Check the folder structure created inside the base path after running the chain
$ ls ./my-chain-state
chains
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/
dev
$ ls ./my-chain-state/chains/dev
db keystore network
```

### Connect with Polkadot-JS Apps Front-End

Similar to other substrate-based nodes, after you start the node locally, you can interact with it using the hosted version of the [Polkadot/Substrate Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer?rpc=ws://localhost:9944) front-end by connecting to the local node endpoint.
